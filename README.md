# CS-250-15794-M01-Software-Development-Lifecycle

Welcome to my Computer Science portfolio! This repository contains projects and assignments from my recent course, showcasing my progress and skills developed between January and March 2025.

## About
This repository is part of my ongoing CS portfolio. Here, you’ll find various projects, coding exercises, and assignments that demonstrate my learning journey. Each project folder includes detailed instructions, code samples, and documentation to help you understand the work.

## New Artifact: Sprint Review and Retrospective
Included in this repository is my **Sprint Review and Retrospective** document for the SNHU Travel project. This artifact demonstrates how our Scrum Team reflected on the pivot to detox and wellness travel, adapted user stories to align with updated acceptance criteria, and incorporated Agile best practices such as iterative planning and Daily Scrums.

## Collaborators
For this assignment, I have added my instructor SandiferSnhu as a collaborator so they can review my portfolio work.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to my instructor and classmates for their ongoing support and guidance.

## Reflections on Key Questions

Below are my brief responses to several essential questions in the Computer Science program. These reflections capture what I have learned about interpreting user needs, implementing Agile processes, and being a productive team member.

1. **How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**  
   In my experience, the best way to interpret user needs is to start with clear, concise user stories that capture exactly what the user hopes to accomplish. A well-formed user story includes acceptance criteria that outline how we can verify whether the feature is complete. By writing these stories from the user’s perspective, we keep our focus on delivering real value rather than getting lost in technical details. This aligns with Agile guidance on continuous collaboration: The Product Owner ensures the team understands the purpose of each story before development begins (Atlassian, 2023).

2. **How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
   I tend to approach development by breaking down work into small, testable increments that can be delivered quickly. I have seen how valuable it is to use Scrum events like Sprint Planning and Daily Standups to maintain a shared understanding of progress. In the future, I plan to keep using backlog refinement sessions to ensure each user story is truly ready. I also hope to integrate automated testing and continuous integration (CI) pipelines for faster feedback cycles, mirroring the Agile principle of early and frequent testing (Project Management Institute, 2021).

3. **What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
   Being a good team member means staying open to feedback, communicating obstacles early, and treating each task as part of a collective goal rather than an individual assignment. In Scrum, transparency and collaboration are key. Raising a concern about potential design issues or volunteering to help teammates struggling with their tasks can prevent bigger issues. Regular check-ins, whether through Daily Scrums or direct messages, help maintain momentum and keep everyone informed. This sense of shared responsibility leads to better outcomes and a more positive team culture.
